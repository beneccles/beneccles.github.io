            <p>As a Developer, I like to break code. Not what you were expecting, right? 
                One of the things I've learned as a Full Stack Developer is that if you want 
                to really understand how code works, take it apart and see where it breaks. 
                Not only do we better understand how a particular function works, we are in a 
                better position to handle errors for it when they come. When I'm not coding, 
                you can find me composing on Piano or playing games like Destiny 2. 
                If you have questions please don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
